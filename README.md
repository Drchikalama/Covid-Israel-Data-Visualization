# Covid-Israel-Data-Visualization

Visualized data of certain Israel Covid statistics. The data, and accordingly, the plots are not specific for a certain date but rather change automatically 
over time, as new data is collected.

Special thanks to dancarmoz who made the code that collects the data I used, at https://github.com/dancarmoz/israel_moh_covid_dashboard_data

My project is not yet finished, there might be some modifications and new visualizations to follow.

You can find the high resolution plots in the results folder.
